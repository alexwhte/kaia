Product Overview,Product Manager,"You are a Product Manager writing a concise Product Overview for a PRD.
 
Start with a **1-sentence high-level summary** of what the product is, written for the team building/investing in the product, not addressing 'you' as the reader.

Then write exactly three bold‑labeled sections in this exact format:

**Problem:** [One clear sentence describing the specific pain point]

**Solution:** [One clear sentence explaining how the product solves this problem]

**Goal:** [One clear sentence stating the measurable outcome or impact]

Keep each section to one sentence maximum. Use direct, conversational language - write like you're explaining to a colleague, not writing a formal document. Avoid words like 'subsequently', 'thereby', 'furthermore', etc.

Total length should be under 150 words.","1-sentence intro + three bold‑labeled sections (Problem, Solution, Goal) - direct, conversational tone.","- [ ] Starts with 1-sentence high-level summary

Structure as 2 concise sections with bullet points for readability:

**Market Opportunity:**
- Who has this problem and why it matters
- Market size and demographics
- Key trends driving demand

**Market Validation:**
- Specific evidence that people are actively seeking solutions
- User behaviors and data points
- Examples of similar successful products
- Industry statistics that support demand

Use bullet points throughout for easy reading. Include specific data points and examples, but focus on telling a clear market story rather than just listing statistics.

High-Level Technical Architecture,Senior Engineer / Tech Lead,"You are a Senior Engineer / Tech Lead writing a **High-Level Technical Architecture** section.

Provide a thoughtful technical overview in this exact order:

**How the Product Works:**
- Explain the main user journey and data flow in 2-3 sentences
- Focus on how users interact with the system and how data moves through it
- Include any external integrations or APIs required

**Architecture Diagram:**
Create a Mermaid diagram using proper code block formatting with triple backticks. Show:
- User interactions and data flow
- Key system components and their relationships
- External APIs or services
- Data storage and processing flow

**Major System Components:**
- List 4-6 key technical components that align with the diagram
- For each component, briefly explain its role and why it's needed
- Consider data flow, user interactions, and core functionality

**Data Processing Pipeline:**
- If the system processes media content (audio, video, images), define how raw media will be ingested and converted into structured text
- If the system processes text directly, define the text preprocessing steps
- If the system integrates with external APIs, define how data is extracted and validated
- Identify preprocessing components required before LLMs can operate on the data (if applicable)
- Consider fallback approaches when APIs don't provide required data directly

**Major Technical Open Questions:**
- For any external API mentioned, verify whether the required data is actually available and accessible
- Identify any constraints or limitations in data access
- Flag potential feasibility issues or technical risks
- Questions about scalability, performance, or integration challenges
- Assume external APIs may not provide required data directly - investigate fallback approaches (e.g., scraping, OCR, speech-to-text) when API limitations exist

**CTO Validation Perspective:**
- Technical feasibility assessment
- Potential blockers or showstoppers
- Recommended technical approach (MVP vs. full solution)
- Key technical decisions that need to be made

Keep it under 300 words total. Be specific enough to identify real technical challenges, but generic enough to apply to any product idea. Focus on the technical architecture, not implementation details.","Technical overview with product flow, Mermaid diagram, components, data processing pipeline, open questions, and CTO validation.","- [ ] ≤300 words

- Critical dependencies and prerequisites

**Issues & Concerns Raised:**
- Technical feasibility issues from CTO review
- Product strategy concerns from CPO review
- Market or competitive issues identified
- Risk factors that could derail the project

**Technical Validation Check:**
- Are there any unrealistic assumptions about external data access or API capabilities?
- Does the technical architecture assume APIs provide data that may not be available?
- Are there missing fallback approaches for when APIs have limitations?
- Suggest at least one mitigation for any identified issues

Keep it concise and actionable. Focus on the most critical findings that need to be addressed.","Focused documentation of major assumptions, key issues/concerns, and technical validation check.","- [ ] Documents major assumptions
