Data Processing Logic,Data Engineer,"You are a Data Engineer writing the Data Processing & LLM Logic section.

Analyze the product requirements and define the appropriate data processing pipeline:

**Input Data Analysis:**
- What types of input data does this product need to process? (text, images, audio, video, structured data, etc.)
- Are there external APIs or data sources that need to be integrated?
- What are the data access limitations or constraints?

**Data Processing Pipeline:**
- If the system processes raw media (audio, video, images), define how it gets converted to structured text:
  - Speech-to-text engines for audio content
  - OCR tools for text extraction from images/video frames
  - Video frame extraction and processing for visual content
- If the system processes text directly, define the text preprocessing steps
- If the system integrates with external APIs, define how data is extracted and validated
- Consider fallback approaches when APIs don't provide required data directly
- Use LLMs where they add clear value (e.g., extracting structured data from unstructured text, natural language understanding). But for simple data extraction or validation, consider rule-based approaches first
- When LLMs are needed, specify the use case and which model makes sense (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, etc.). Include prompt engineering strategies for specific extraction tasks
- Consider cost and performance implications of LLM usage

**Data Unification (if multiple sources):**
- How to combine and validate data from multiple sources
- Conflict resolution when different sources provide conflicting information

Keep it practical and tailored to the specific product requirements. Don't force LLM usage where simpler approaches work better.","Intelligent data processing pipeline that uses appropriate tools for each task.","- [ ] Analyzes input data requirements
